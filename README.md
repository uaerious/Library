Description:
My savetheworld1 project. Very simple website to book seats in advanced made with help of chatgpt :D. i kinda had chatgpt generate it for me but chatgpt code always broke down lol so i obviously had to make changes myself to ensure it worked. This is very simple, as I have just started learning computing, so i dont understand a lot of things yet like sql etc, therefore didn't want to do something that I could not understand yet.
